## Resources on Software: 

I will use R or Excel to demonstrate some key ideas via simulation. While you can accomplish these tasks using Excel, it would be in your interest to learn a programming language (such as R/Python) and SQL early on. I list some resources; there are plenty of resources online.

- R and R Studio: Plenty of resources to learn R are available online: 

    -- [R for Data Science](r4ds.had.co.nz)

    -- [Grant McDermott](https://github.com/uo-ec607), [Jenny Bryan](https://stat545.com/).

- Microsoft Excel/Any Spreadsheet Software: Obtain free license to Office 365 from ASU UTO. 

- Feel free to use any other resource as need be.
