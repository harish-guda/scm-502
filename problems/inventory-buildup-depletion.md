# Questions

Some questions from past exams are listed below. 

## ASU's Football Stadium

The first ASU game I attended (Fall 2019, pre-pandemic) was ASU vs. USC, which ASU lost. It inspired me to write this [question](/problem-files/problems/inventory-buildup/asu-vs-usc.pdf). 

## Port of LA

Perhaps, the biggest point of discussion during the holiday season in Fall 2021 were the logjams at the port of LA and LB (Los Angeles and Long Beach). These incidents inspired me to write this [question](/problem-files/problems/inventory-buildup/port-la.pdf). During the follow-up (in-class) discussion, I showed [this](https://on.wsj.com/2Xz7Vft) video from WSJ, that highlights the role of capacity vs. demand rate in inventory buildup.
